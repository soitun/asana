#Social Asana#

We found it tedious to use multiple web apps to manage our social media campaigns -- and the best ones charge money. Asana is a free, easy way to schedule our updates, get feedback, and keep track of our Klout analytics. Feel free to join in on the action!

**We plan to use:** 

* Facebook Api
* Twitter Api
* Klout Api
